    <rule>
        <name>Canonical URLs</name>
        <note>
            On some webservers there are more than one URL for a resource. Usually there are canonical URLs (which
            should be actually used and distributed) and those which are just shortcuts, internal ones, etc. Independent
            of which URL the user supplied with the request he should finally see the canonical one only.

            We do an external HTTP redirect for all non-canonical URLs to fix them in the location view of the Browser
            and for all subsequent requests. In the example ruleset below we replace /~user by the canonical /u/user and
            fix a missing trailing slash for /u/user.

            RewriteRule ^/~([^/]+)/?(.*) /u/$1/$2 [R]
            RewriteRule ^/([uge])/([^/]+)$ /$1/$2/ [R]
        </note>
        <from>^/~([^/]+)/?(.*)</from>
        <to type="redirect">/u/$1/$2</to>
    </rule>
    <rule>
        <from>^/([uge])/([^/]+)$</from>

    </rule>


    <rule>
        <name>Canonical Hostnames</name>
        <note>
            The goal of this rule is to force the use of a particular hostname, in preference to other hostnames which
            may be used to reach the same site. For example, if you wish to force the use of www.example.com instead of
            example.com, you might use a variant of the following recipe.

            RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^fully\.qualified\.domain\.name [NC]
            RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^$
            RewriteRule ^/(.*) http://fully.qualified.domain.name/$1 [L,R]
        </note>
        <condition name="host">!^fully\.qualified\.domain\.name</condition>
        <condition name="host" operator="notequal">^$</condition>
        <from>^/(.*)</from>

    </rule>


    <rule>
        <name>Moved DocumentRoot</name>
        <note>
            Usually the DocumentRoot of the webserver directly relates to the URL "/". But often this data is not
            really of top-level priority, it is perhaps just one entity of a lot of data pools. For instance at our
            Intranet sites there are /e/www/ (the homepage for WWW), /e/sww/ (the homepage for the Intranet) etc. Now
            because the data of the DocumentRoot stays at /e/www/ we had to make sure that all inlined images and other
            stuff inside this data pool work for subsequent requests.

            We just redirect the URL / to /e/www/. While is seems trivial it is actually trivial with mod_rewrite, only.
            Because the typical old mechanisms of URL Aliases (as provides by mod_alias and friends) only used prefix
            matching. With this you cannot do such a redirection because the DocumentRoot is a prefix of all URLs.
            With mod_rewrite it is really trivial:

            RewriteRule ^/$ /e/www/ [R]
        </note>
        <from>^/$</from>
        <to type="redirect">/e/www/</to>
    </rule>


    <rule>
        <name>Trailing Slash Problem</name>
        <note>
            Every webmaster can sing a song about the problem of the trailing slash on URLs referencing directories.
            If they are missing, the server dumps an error, because if you say /~quux/foo instead of /~quux/foo/ then
            the server searches for a file named foo. And because this file is a directory it complains. Actually it
            tries to fix it itself in most of the cases, but sometimes this mechanism need to be emulated by you. For
            instance after you have done a lot of complicated URL rewritings to CGI scripts etc.

            The solution to this subtle problem is to let the server add the trailing slash automatically. To do this
            correctly we have to use an external redirect, so the browser correctly requests subsequent images etc. If
            we only did a internal rewrite, this would only work for the directory page, but would go wrong when any
            images are included into this page with relative URLs, because the browser would request an in-lined object.
            For instance, a request for image.gif in /~quux/foo/index.html would become /~quux/image.gif without the
            external redirect!

        <name>Move Homedirs to Different Webserver</name>
        <note>
            Many webmasters have asked for a solution to the following situation: They wanted to redirect just all
            homedirs on a webserver to another webserver. They usually need such things when establishing a newer
            webserver which will replace the old one over time.

            The solution is trivial with mod_rewrite (and urlrewrite filter). On the old webserver we just redirect all
            /~user/anypath URLs to http://newserver/~user/anypath.

            RewriteRule ^/~(.+) http://newserver/~$1 [R,L]
        </note>
        <from>^/~(.+)</from>
        <to type="redirect" last="true">http://newserver/~$1</to>
    </rule>


    <rule>
        <name>Structured Homedirs</name>
        <note>
            Some sites with thousands of users usually use a structured homedir layout, i.e. each homedir is in a
            subdirectory which begins for instance with the first character of the username. So, /~foo/anypath is
            /home/f/foo/.www/anypath while /~bar/anypath is /home/b/bar/.www/anypath.

            We use the following ruleset to expand the tilde URLs into exactly the above layout.

            RewriteRule ^/~(([a-z])[a-z0-9]+)(.*) /home/$2/$1/.www$3
        </note>
        <from>^/~(([a-z])[a-z0-9]+)(.*)</from>
        <to>/home/$2/$1/.www$3</to>
    </rule>


    <rule>
        <name>Redirect Homedirs For Foreigners</name>
        <note>
            We want to redirect homedir URLs to another webserver www.somewhere.com when the requesting user does not
            stay in the local domain ourdomain.com. This is sometimes used in virtual host contexts.

            Just a rewrite condition:

            RewriteCond %{REMOTE_HOST} !^.+\.ourdomain\.com$
            RewriteRule ^(/~.+) http://www.somewhere.com/$1 [R,L]
        </note>
        <condition name="host">!^.+\.ourdomain\.com$</condition>
        <from>^(/~.+)</from>
        <to type="redirect" last="true">http://www.somewhere.com/$1</to>
    </rule>


    <rule>
        <name>Time-Dependent Rewriting</name>
        <note>
            When tricks like time-dependent content should happen a lot of webmasters still use CGI scripts which do for
            instance redirects to specialized pages. How can it be done via mod_rewrite?

            There are a lot of types in conjunction with operators we can do time-dependent redirects:

            RewriteCond %{TIME_HOUR}%{TIME_MIN} &gt;0700
            RewriteCond %{TIME_HOUR}%{TIME_MIN} &lt;1900
            RewriteRule ^foo\.html$ foo.day.html
            RewriteRule ^foo\.html$ foo.night.html
        </note>
        <condition type="hourofday" operator="greater">7</condition>
        <condition type="hourofday" operator="less">19</condition>
        <from>^foo\.html$</from>
        <to>foo.day.html</to>
    </rule>
    <rule>
        <from>^foo\.html$</from>
        <to>foo.night.html</to>
    </rule>


    <rule>
        <name></name>
        <note>
            Assume we have recently renamed the page foo.html to bar.html and now want to provide the old URL for
            backward compatibility. Actually we want that users of the old URL even not recognize that the pages was
            renamed.

            We rewrite the old URL to the new one internally via the following rule:

            RewriteBase /~quux/
            RewriteRule ^foo\.html$ bar.html
        </note>
        <from>^/~quux/foo\.html$</from>
        <to>/~quux/bar.html</to>
    </rule>


    <rule>
        <name>From Old to New (extern)</name>
        <note>
            Assume again that we have recently renamed the page foo.html to bar.html and now want to provide the old URL
            for backward compatibility. But this time we want that the users of the old URL get hinted to the new one,
            i.e. their browsers Location field should change, too.

            We force a HTTP redirect to the new URL which leads to a change of the browsers and thus the users view:

            RewriteBase /~quux/
            RewriteRule ^foo\.html$ bar.html [R]
        </note>
        <from>^/~quux/foo\.html$</from>
        <to type="redirect">/~quux/bar.html</to>
    </rule>


    <rule>
        <name>Browser Dependent Content</name>
        <note>
            At least for important top-level pages it is sometimes necessary to provide the optimum of browser dependent
            content, i.e. one has to provide a maximum version for the latest Netscape variants, a minimum version for
            the Lynx browsers and a average feature version for all others.

            We cannot use content negotiation because the browsers do not provide their type in that form. Instead we
            have to act on the HTTP header "User-Agent". The following condig does the following: If the HTTP header
            "User-Agent" begins with "Mozilla/3", the page foo.html is rewritten to foo.NS.html and and the rewriting
            stops. If the browser is "Lynx" or "Mozilla" of version 1 or 2 the URL becomes foo.20.html. All other
            browsers receive page foo.32.html. This is done by the following ruleset:

            RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} ^Mozilla/3.*
            RewriteRule ^foo\.html$ foo.NS.html [L]

            RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} ^Lynx/.* [OR]
            RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} ^Mozilla/[12].*
            RewriteRule ^foo\.html$ foo.20.html [L]

            RewriteRule ^foo\.html$ foo.32.html [L]
        </note>
        <condition name="user-agent">^Mozilla/3.*</condition>
        <from>^foo\.html$</from>
        <to last="true">foo.NS.html</to>

        <name>From Static to Dynamic</name>
        <note>
            How can we transform a static page foo.html into a dynamic variant foo.cgi in a seamless way, i.e. without
            notice by the browser/user.

            We just rewrite the URL to the jsp/servlet and force the correct MIME-type so it gets really run as
            a CGI-script. This way a request to /~quux/foo.html internally leads to the invocation of /~quux/foo.jsp.

            RewriteBase /~quux/
            RewriteRule ^foo\.html$ foo.cgi [T=application/x-httpd-cgi]
        </note>

        <name>Blocking of Robots</name>
        <note>
            How can we block a really annoying robot from retrieving pages of a specific webarea? A /robots.txt file
            containing entries of the "Robot Exclusion Protocol" is typically not enough to get rid of such a robot.

            We use a ruleset which forbids the URLs of the webarea /~quux/foo/arc/ (perhaps a very deep directory
            indexed area where the robot traversal would create big server load). We have to make sure that we forbid
            access only to the particular robot, i.e. just forbidding the host where the robot runs is not enough.
            This would block users from this host, too. We accomplish this by also matching the User-Agent HTTP header
            information.

            RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} ^NameOfBadRobot.*
            RewriteCond %{REMOTE_ADDR} ^123\.45\.67\.[8-9]$

            Assume we have under http://www.quux-corp.de/~quux/ some pages with inlined GIF graphics. These graphics are
            nice, so others directly incorporate them via hyperlinks to their pages. We don't like this practice because
            it adds useless traffic to our server.

            While we cannot 100% protect the images from inclusion, we can at least restrict the cases where the browser
            sends a HTTP Referer header.
